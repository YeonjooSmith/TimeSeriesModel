# Forecasting house prices using ARIMA time series estimation
This project is to pick 5 zip codes that are the "best" for real estate investments by using  ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) models based on the average house prices in the past. 

# Techniques used in this project
* Time Series Analysis
* AutoCorrelation Funcion(ACF) and Partial AutoCorrelation Function(PACF)
* Dicky-Fuller Test
* Rolling mean and rolling standare deviation
* Visualizations
* ARIMA modeling
* One-step and dynamic forecasts

* First, read the non-technical summary of the project(the presentation slides in PDF format) to understand the whole picture
* Second, follow the codes in `TitmeSeries_HousePrice_finalDraft.ipynb` after installing libraries listed at the begining part of the notebook.
